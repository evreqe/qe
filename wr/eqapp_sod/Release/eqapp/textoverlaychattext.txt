You must first select a target for this spell
Your spell fizzles
Your spell is interrupted
Your spell did not take hold
Your target resisted
You resist
has worn off
You feel yourself starting to appear
You have no more room
You must be standing to forage
You can't fish without fishing bait
Your fishing pole broke
growls...
DEVASTATING BLOW
