You must first select a target for this spell
Your spell fizzles
Your spell is interrupted
Your spell did not take hold
Your target resisted

has worn off
You are too fatigued to jump
YOU were injured by falling
You feel yourself starting to appear
You cannot see your target
You have no more room
You must be standing to forage
You can't fish without fishing bait
Your fishing pole broke
